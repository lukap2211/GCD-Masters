Information system includes:
- CMS - Content Management System, an interface that is used by moderators to edit content), • API - Application Programming Interface, data manipulation and deliver,
- Web application - web site for the users that consume content using mobile devices.

Technologies and languages used on this project:
- PHP - for building API and snippet code within CMS,
- MySQL - database that stores data,
- HTML5, CSS3 - for making the web pages,
- Google Maps API v3 - for providing maps and geolocation information,
- Twitter Bootstrap 2.3.2 - for making CMS user interface,
- jQuery - Javascript library for HTML manipulation, event handling, animation and AJAX,
- Responsive Web method for building Web Application.

The idea of the project is to crete a platform that could be used by clients like museums, resorts, parks, or similar institution to quickly implement and offer their visitors unique multimedia experience while making sure that their visitors are getting genuine and authentic content that is easy to maintain.

For purpose of this dissertation, several locations are defined as a demonstration environment (Griffith College Campus, Smithfield Square, Phoenix Park, and city of Dublin).
